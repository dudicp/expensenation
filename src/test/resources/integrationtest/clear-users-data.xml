Good setup don't need cleanup!
Don't be afraid to leave your trace after a test;principally if you are using one database instance per developer.
If you always put your database in a known state before a test execution, you usually don't need to clean it up..
This simplifies your tests maintenance and reduces the overhead taken by the cleanup procedure.
And sometimes, this is very helpful to manually verify the database state after executing a test that fails.
